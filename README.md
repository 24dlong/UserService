# UserService
The ParkService repository is a proof of concept .NET GraphQL service. Together with the following repositories, it's
meant to demonstrate how a Gateway Service can be used along with GraphQL Federation to create a single GraphQL API from
multiple GraphQL microservices:
- [ParkService](https://github.com/24dlong/ParkService)
- [HikeService](https://github.com/24dlong/HikeService)
- [GatewayService](https://github.com/24dlong/GatewayService)

The UserService provides a REST API and GraphQL API for managing users of a fictional application.

## Running the Service
1. Run `make bootstrap` to run the service using Docker
2. An overview of the REST API can be found at http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html
3. An overview of the GraphQL API and a UI for making requests can be found at http://localhost:5000/graphql/

### Making a GraphQL Request
1. In your browser, open http://localhost:5000/graphql/
1. Click on the 'Operation' tab
1. In the Request pane, paste in the following GQL query:
    ```gql
    query {
      users {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ```
1. Hit the 'Run' button to execute your GraphQL request

Alternatively, you can make a POST request to the /graphql endpoint using your API Client of choice. For more info on
structuring a GraphQL request, see [Make an HTTP call with GraphQL](
https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-http/).

## Building a Docker Image
1. If you want to build a docker image for the service without running it, you can execute `make build`
